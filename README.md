# Community-MySQL-API

Hello Readers!

We will be explaining how we use this API here and what we have learned while making this API.

npm run dev - this is hard we are currently starting the API.

10/11 - 10/12
We learned that empty .js files in the models folder throws an error.
Not quite sure why at the moment.
